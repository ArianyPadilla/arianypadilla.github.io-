        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Ariany Padilla. I am 21 years old. I am a first-generation college student. Iâ€™m a full time student and on top of that I work full time. I am my parents' personal translator which means I help them with paperwork or making phone calls.<br><br>

        My job title is a behavioral therapist as well as a caregiver. I work with kids who have special needs. I go to school with my client and I also provide direct services to him there and his home. I have been in this field for more than two years now. I enjoy working with kids and being able to see the progress they make. You may ask who got me into this job and it was my younger sister. My younger sister is autistic. Since she was very little I have been involved in every step of her progress. Being involved with my sister made me realize that I am capable of helping other kids with different needs. I become more interested in finding a way to help kids with special needs who have behaviors. I decided to join the ABA field. I feel truly blessed to be in this field. I plan on working towards the goal of becoming a supervisor. I enjoy working in what I do, I am always up on my toes with my clients.<br><br>

        A few fun facts about me: I lived in Washington for a few years and came back to California after 5 years. I love Winnie The Pooh, my mission is to decorate half of my room with pooh's stuff. I am 4â€™11 which my family canâ€™t seem to get over. Especially my brother! I am very creative, with ideas for kids in order to tell me how they feel. I find ways for them to communicate with me and make things fun so it doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s a personal goal. I am super social with those around me and with strangers as well. I greet everyone with a smile regardless of how my day is going. My favorite holiday is Christmas because its like a second birthday to me. Do you think the same way? 
Something I enjoy doing is being around my family. My boyfriend and I went to Six Flags and Disneyland last year near Christmas time and it was so beautiful. I enjoy going out to try new foods and explore new places. I plan on traveling in the future once I have my career done. The most valuable thing for me is my family and their health. A few hobbies I have are doing makeup, making puzzles, but my favorite one is reading books. I currently enjoy reading books from Colleen Hoover. Her writing is so vivid and it feels so real when she is expressing what is going to happen next. Books have always been fun for me to read. A bit strange huh, not many people like to read nowadays.
